# DATABASES
SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language<BR>
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.<BR>
SQL COMMANDS<BR>
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.<br>
<UL>
  <LI>SELECT - extracts data from a database</LI>
  <LI>UPDATE - updates data in a database</LI>
  <LI>DELETE - deletes data from a database</LI>
  <LI>INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database</LI>
  <LI>CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database</LI>
  <LI>ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database</LI>
  <LI>CREATE TABLE - creates a new table</LI>
  <LI>ALTER TABLE - modifies a table</LI>
  <LI>DROP TABLE - deletes a table</LI>
</UL>
<ul>
  <li>The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
    If you want to return all columns, without specifying every column name, you can use the SELECT * syntax</li>
  <li>The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
   The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.</li>
  <li>The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
  The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.</li>
  <li>The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition.
  The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.</li>
  <li>The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition.
  The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.</li>
  <li>The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.</li>
  <li>The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.</li>
  <li>The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.</li>
</ul>
SQL FUNCTIONS<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>COUNT:function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion</LI>
  <LI>SUM:function returns the total sum of a numeric column.</LI>
  <LI>AVG:function returns the average value of a numeric column.</LI>
</UL>
SQL OPERATORS<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>LIKE: used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.</LI>
  There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
  <LI>The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters</LI>
  <LI> The underscore sign _ represents one, single character</LI>
  <LI>IN:allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.</LI>
  <LI>BETWEEN:selects values within a given range</LI>
